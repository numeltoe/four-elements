                                The auroras are usually found overhead the polar regions.

                                    Their name means "night shining" in Latin, which is quite appropriate, as they are only visible during twilight.</p>

                                Most of this oxygen, which we require to live, was produced by photosynthetic organisms like plants and cyanobacteria.
