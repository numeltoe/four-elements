                red cloths, or anything else that reminds you of the passion and fire within you. Find a sacred spot, and arrange the items there in a way 
                that feels inspirational to you (feel free to experiment and rearrange them--there's no wrong answer!), and take a moment now and then to come 
                to the shrine and nurture your connection with the spirit of Fire whenever you feel the need to stoke the fires of passion, connection with the past, and purpose within you.</p>

        <h3 style="color:red;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire and Biology: Mutualism<br><br></h3>
        <p style="font-size:18px;text-align:left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire has a deep relationship with life on Earth. In fact, some have suggested that Fire itself is alive, as it consumes energy to survive, reproduces by spreading and starting other fires, and leaves behind waste in the form of ash. Fire on Earth is dependent on a living matrix to survive, and many organisms and ecosystems on Earth in turn depend on 
        Fire to grow and reproduce. For example, the cones of the old man banksia, <i>Banksia serrata</i>, are pyriscent, meaning that they open and release their seeds following bushfires. Other plants have seeds that only germinate after a fire; many examples of these plants, such as Coffeeberry and Redberry, both in the buckthorn family, can be found in the chaparral communities of California. 
        The spread of cities and suburbs into fire-prone regions of the world has suppressed the normal cycles of fire in these areas, leading to the buildup of undergrowth and brush over time, and causing the fires that do occur to be more explosive and larger than they would otherwise be.</p><br>
        <h3 style="color:red;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire and Humanity: an Ancestral Flame</h3>
        <br><p style="font-size:18px;text-align:left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, too, have a long and intimate relationship with fire. It is unclear when humans first began controlling fire, but some evidence suggests that this occurred even before the development of anatomically modern humans: according to the “cooking hypothesis” of Richard Wrangham, a professor of biological anthropology 
        at Harvard University and the author of “Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human,” “Homo erectus was adapted to a diet of cooked food and therefore was capable of controlling fire (1). Recent phylogenetic studies on nonhuman and human primates based on associated trends in body mass, 
        feeding time, and molar size support the hypothesis of the adoption of a cooked diet at least as early as the first appearance of H. erectus approximately 1.9 Ma (2)," as cited in the research article <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/109/20/E1215" target="_blank">"Microstratigraphic evidence of in situ fire in the Acheulean strata of Wonderwerk Cave, Northern Cape province, South Africa"</a> . In this way, after fire was shaped by us for long enough, fire in turn began to shape our biology. The aforementioned article also provides direct evidence of fire control dating back from around 1 million years ago in a South African cave.
        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire has been used for much of human history to modify the natural environment. Before European colonization of North America, for example, Native American groups set fires for such purposes as managing game migration and clearing the land for agriculture; much of the American Midwest was dominated by open savannah as a result of these fires. 
        As Native Americans were forced out of their homelands by the settlers, these ecosystems changed, and “vast areas in riparian bottomlands reverted to forest,” according to <a href="https://www.firescience.gov/projects/09-2-01-9/supdocs/09-2-01-9_Chapter_6_Fire_History_The_View_from_Ecosystems.pdf target=_blank">this document from firescience.gov</a>. </p>
