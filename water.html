            <br><p style="font-size:18px;text-align:left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thought that not much water was present on Earth initially after its formation, based on its position within the protoplanetary disc that gave rise to the Solar System. Rather, some combination of comets and asteroids pummeled the Earth’s surface in the eons following, bringing water to our planet from space. For more about this, refer to 
                <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-did-water-get-on-earth/" target="blank">this article.</a>
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth is in the “Goldilocks Zone” of the Solar System—not too close or far from the Sun, so that water mostly remains liquid on Earth’s surface rather than evaporating into water vapor or freezing into ice. However, there has been at least one “Snowball Earth” even in our planet’s history, during which the oceans were almost entirely frozen, aside for perhaps a few small oases of liquid water.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much evidence supports the idea that life on Earth originated in the ocean—perhaps in a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. It is thought that it wasn’t until about 430 million years ago that multicellular life made the transition to life on land, in the midst of the Cambrian Explosion. And, even land-dwelling organisms maintain a homeostatic balance of water and salts within themselves, essentially 
                holding an internal ocean that is separate from and protected from the drying air. Every single organism on Earth requires water to survive.
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most of Earth’s life, its atmosphere had very little oxygen. This changed over time, as cyanobacteria and algae in the oceans photosynthesized, creating oxygen as a waste product. This created the ozone layer, and enabled life on land to evolve. 
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <h3 style="color:blue;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water and Humanity: a Rising Tide</h3>
                <p style="font-size:18px;text-align:left;"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The need for water is one of those universal parts of the human experience. Water is a fundamental part of many human creation myths: for example, the Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois, creation story,  begins “long, long ago” in a time when the Earth was covered entirely in water, and the only creatures to be found were water creatures. You can find this story
                <a href="https://www.oneidaindiannation.com/the-haudenosaunee-creation-story/"
                target="_blank"> here.</a>
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                After the discovery of agriculture, many of the first civilizations, such as the Egyptians and Mesopotamians, rose up around rivers and river deltas. Many of these civilizations built complex irrigation systems, which were often fundamental to their rise; one hypothesis, the hydraulic hypothesis, claims that civilizations formed directly in response to the need 
                for a year-round supply of water in semi-arid regions of the world. 
                Regardless of this idea’s complete accuracy, there is no doubt that the need to manage and control water, and the rise and continued success of civilizations, have been deeply intertwined. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00438240802668354" target="_blank">Read more about ancient civilizations and water in this article.</a>
                    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is so, then it stands to reason that losing control of a reliable and clean water source would spell the end of civilization. Yet, our current civilization threatens our water supply, polluting it with industrial waste and dumping plastic waste into the oceans. With this in mind, let us continue to work and fight
                    together to preserve and protect our planet’s water for the generations to come.</p>
